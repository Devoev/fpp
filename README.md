This repo contains code for fpp, a basic finite element solver in C++.

## Project structure

### Mesh
Code for handling mesh data is located in `fem/mesh/`. Only 2D triangular meshes are supported by the `TriangularMesh2D` struct.
A mesh object can be constructed by the `TriangularMesh2D::parse` function, that reads data from a `.msh` file generated by [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/).

### Matrix assembly
Code for the assembly for mass and stiffness matrices is found in `fem/matrix`. As of now, only nodal matrices are implemented in `nodal_mat.h`.

### Other code
Utility functions the calculation of geometrical quantities for 2D triangles are located in `fem/util/`.

### Examples
In the `examples/` folder python scripts generating 2D meshes using gmsh are located. The generated `.msh` files can be used with the fpp code.
